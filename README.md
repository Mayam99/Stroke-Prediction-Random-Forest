# Stroke-Prediction-Random-Forest

Introduction

The Stroke Prediction Dataset is a comprehensive dataset available on Kaggle that contains 11 clinical features for predicting stroke events. Stroke is a severe medical condition where poor blood flow to the brain results in cell death. It is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, making accurate prediction and timely intervention critical. This dataset provides valuable data for building predictive models to identify individuals at high risk of stroke.

Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following 11 clinical features:

id: Unique identifier

gender: Gender of the patient

age: Age of the patient

hypertension: 0 if the patient does not have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

heart_disease: 0 if the patient does not have heart disease, 1 if the patient has heart disease

ever_married: Whether the patient has ever been married (Yes or No)

work_type: Type of occupation (e.g., children, government job, never worked, private, self-employed)

Residence_type: Type of residence (Urban or Rural)

avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in the blood

bmi: Body mass index

smoking_status: Smoking status (formerly smoked, never smoked, smokes, unknown)

stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 if not

Objective

The primary objective of this dataset is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify the likelihood of a stroke based on the clinical features provided. This can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention, potentially saving lives and reducing the burden of stroke-related disabilities.

Usage

This dataset is ideal for applying various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. It offers an excellent opportunity to explore feature selection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a real-world healthcare context.
